KMeansInMapReduce
=================

This project implements K-means clustering algorithm in MapReduce, Hadoop 2.0. The purpose of this project is not to provide an alternative version of K-Means clustering algorithms in Apache Mahout. Instead, this project aims to help people who are not using Mahout, Spark or other Hadoop machine learning libraries to implement K-means in their Hadoop projects. The standard version of K-means is implemented and the mathematics of the algorithm can be found in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering . 

In this project, one k-means iteraction
